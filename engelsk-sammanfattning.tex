The Equipment Controls and Electronics section at \abbrCERN is developing a high precision piezo-actuated rotational stage for the UA9 crystal collimation project. Several control-related issues arising with the complexity and operational environment of the system make it difficult to design a controller that achieves the desired performance. This thesis aims to identify different control approaches that can be applicable to this problem.
