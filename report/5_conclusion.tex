\section{Conclusions}

As seen in the zoom-in, the \abbrIRC is slightly more damped but has a high frequency ringing in 448Hz, the same frequency as the model's second resonance peak. In reality it would be plenty of  higher resonance (all are not modeled) that will lead to more ringing and bad disturbance rejection.

\section{Future work}

To achieve intersample disturbance rejection, a multi rate control technique with a control period shorter than the sampling rate can be implemented, as proposed in \citep{fujimoto2009rro}. However if
