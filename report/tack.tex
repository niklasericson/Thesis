First of all, I would like to thank \abbrCERN and the \abbrENSTIECE section for giving me this opportunity. Especially my supervisors, Mark Butcher and Pablo Serrano Galvez, for interesting discussions and all the support that you have provided me with during my work with this thesis.

I would also like to thank my examiner Svante Gunnarsson and my supervisor Måns Klingspor at the Division of Automatic Control, Linköping University for your academic guidance and your flexibility in giving me support even though I have been located in Geneva.

Finally, I would like to express my gratitude to my friends and family and especially to my girlfriend Frida for your never ending support. Thank you all for encouraging me in my decision to move to Geneva. Without your love and support none of this would have been possible. Thank you.
