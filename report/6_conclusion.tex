\chapter{Conclusion and Future work}\label{cha:conclusion}
This thesis has investigating in different control approaches aiming to improve the tracking capability of the crystals used in the UA9 collimation studies at \abbrCERN. The investigation showed that the \abbrIRC method can be used efficiently to attenuate the first resonance mode and increase the closed loop bandwidth. It also showed that the \abbrMRACPE can be used to adapt to the model changes and prevent instability and that harmonic cancellation can be used to efficiently damp out known harmonic disturbances. Finally a feedforward harmonic cancellation method (\abbrRFDC) was implemented and proposed as an add-on control algorithm. This algorithm was first introduced for the control of hardware drives but has in this thesis shown to be effective with piezo electric actuators and monolithic structures as well.

\section{Conclusions}
As seen in the zoom-in, the \abbrIRC is slightly more damped but has a high frequency ringing in 448Hz, the same frequency as the model's second resonance peak. In reality it would be plenty of  higher resonance (all are not modeled) that will lead to more ringing and bad disturbance rejection.

Easy to amplify instead of cancel, disturbance feedforward.  In general, this method is not robust to model changes and can easily amplify non-modeled disturbance behavior. Not the same behavior for in and out.



The \abbrIRC method performed well in the simulations showing good attenuation of the first resonance peak. Due to its high bandwidth, it was expected that the \abbrIRC should outperform the present controller with respect to tracking performance. However, neither the present nor the \abbrIRC eliminates the constant ramp tracking error completely due to non existing pure integrator in the controller. The high bandwidth also implies in a controller that is more sensitive to measurement noise and to model errors in terms of stability, as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:model_dist_high_order}.



All experimental tests were performed on a damaged rotational stage, which implied in a standard deviation varying between \unit{1}{\micro\radian} and \unit{5}{\micro\radian} in closed loop operation. Such a large varying standard deviation makes it difficult to compare 2 acquisitions that was not successively acquired directly after one another. Hence, the reduction of the yaw angle shown in for instance Figure~\ref{fig:yl_closedloop_80} and \ref{fig:yl_closedloop_50} should only be taken as an indication of the harmonic cancellation capability. This also explains the big difference between the open and closed loop performance, shown in Figure~\ref{fig:fft_openloop_80} and Figure~\ref{fig:fft_closedloop_80}, that in theory should have the same , cancellation performance after the response has settled.

Acquisitions were also taken under non-optimal circumstances with ongoing construction work close to the laboratory area. This explains some of the quick oscillations in the cancellation effectiveness seen as a temporarily increase in the yaw angle deviation in Figure~\ref{fig:transient_closedloop_50}. However, these disturbances are usually very low frequent and does not affect the high frequency region in the \abbrFFT.



\section{Future work}

To achieve intersample disturbance rejection, a multi rate control technique with a control period shorter than the sampling rate can be implemented, as proposed in \citep{fujimoto2009rro}. However if
