The Equipment Controls and Electronics section at \abbrCERN is developing a high precision piezo-actuated rotational stage for the UA9 crystal collimation project. Several control-related issues arising from the complexity and operational environment of the system make it difficult to design a controller that achieves the desired performance. This thesis has investigating in different control approaches aiming to improve the tracking capability of the rotational stage. This thesis has shown that an \abbrIRC method can be used efficiently to attenuate the first resonance mode and to increase the closed loop bandwidth. It also showed that harmonic cancellation can be used to efficiently damp out known harmonic disturbances. Finally a feedforward harmonic cancellation method (\abbrRFDC) was implemented and proposed as an add-on to the present control algorithm.
