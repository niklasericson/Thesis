\chapter{Piezoelectric actuators}\label{cha:}
This thesis will identify possible control approaches that could be applicable to the rotational stage at \abbrCERN in order to meet the performance requirements.
First of all, a brief analysis of the already developed controller will be done in order to point out the drawbacks and determine which controller qualities that have to be improved in order to achieved the desired performance during linear movement of the rotational stage. The main work will then consist of investigating different control approaches such as feedforward, H-infinity, iterative or state feedback control. The most promising approaches will be benchmarked in simulations and compared to the existing algorithm. Finally, the most promising alternative will be implemented and tested on the real rotational stage.
