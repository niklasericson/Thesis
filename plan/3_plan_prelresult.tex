\chapter{Result}\label{cha:result}
This section describes future results that could be expected half way through the project.

\section{Control Approaches}
Half way through the project, all control approaches that have been identified should be presented here. Furthermore, all control approaches that at the time have been simulated will be presented with a schematic structure, transfer functions or state space model, a design analysis of the closed loop system and additional plots for illustration of the trajectory tracking capability and the robustness.

\section{Benchmark tests}
Benchmark tests will be carried out on all simulated control approaches and presented here. Comparisons between the new control approaches and the existing algorithm with respect to disturbance rejection, trajectory tracking and closed loop bandwidth will be illustrated in this section with plots and tables.
