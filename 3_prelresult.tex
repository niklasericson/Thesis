\chapter{Result}\label{cha:metod}
This section describes future results that could be expected half way through the project.

\section{Control Approaches}
Most of the control approaches should already be identified half way trough the project and most of the literature study shall be finished.
All control approaches that at the time have been simulated will be presented with a schematic structure, transfer functions or state space model, a bode plot of the closed loop system and additional plots for illustration of the trajectory tracking capability and the robustness.

\section{Benchmark tests}
Benchmark tests will be carried out on all simulated control approaches and presented here. Comparisons between the new control approaches and the existing algorithm with respect to disturbance rejection, trajectory tracking and bandwidth will be illustrated in plots and tables.
